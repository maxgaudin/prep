# Pass the test

You must pass at least one of the Operation Spark Bootcamp entrance tests.  You will be tested at Operation Spark HQ under a time limit.

## Take Away

Below are the concepts you should come away with and on which you’ll be quizzed.  **You will want to make notes on these items as you go through the Prep material and ENSURE you understand them.**  If you’re fuzzy on some points, Googling is the best way to figure it out.  Self-directed learning and research is the BEST way to solve micro-problems when attacking complex problems in software development, so you should early on practice and develop the reflex to Google-it!

Finally, we have more reading resources online at Operation Spark that cover all topics addressed.  See the table of contents for this material, here:

Here’s what you should understand at the end of Prep:


1. What are variables? How do we define them and why do we use them?
2. What are some of the basic built-in data types? By data types, we mean, types of things - the things you use in your app.
3. What is a String? How do we often use them?
4. What is a Boolean? When would we use a Boolean?
5. What is an Array, why do we use them, how do we access their elements, and what is the syntax for creating a literal Array?
6. What is an Object, how do they differ from Arrays, how do we access their values, and what is the syntax for creating a literal Object?
7. What is a conditional statement (if statement). Why do we use them and what is the syntax for creating one?
8. What is a loop, why do we use loops, and, naming one, what is the syntax for creating that loop?
9. What is a function, how do we define a function, how do we call (or execute) a function, and what do we use them?  What are parameters and what is a return value?
