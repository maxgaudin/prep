# In Person Attendance

The best way to become proficient at any skill is to hang around people that are very good at that skill. To show your commitment to the program, **come to study and work at our headquarters for at least 4 days in a row**.  This frequency of attendance shows us that you’re serious about succeeding, and it will give you a sense of what the Bootcamp experience is all about. Show up for at least an hour each day and ideally more.
