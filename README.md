Welcome
=======

Welcome Agent! Weâ€™re super excited to learn some code with you. To secure your spot in a Bootcamp, in seven steps, you must exhibit desire, commitment, grit and aptitude by **complete all of the following, in order**. It should take you between 10 to 25 hours to complete and should be done at least a week or two before the start of class.

Also, bear in mind, **the Prep material MUST BE 100% complete**, and we have our reasons for this requirement, one of which is that you will NEED to know this material come day one of Bootcamp, so please make note of this, and please do not let anyone tell you that you can skip any of these steps or any part of these steps.  

See the **Take Away** section in Step 7 for topics terms and concepts you should know by the end of the Prep program.

Happy coding!
